These are some projects I've developed that aren't open source for various reasons.

## MegaphoneX

A Twitter AutoDM tool designed for giveaways. Users create a tweet instructing their followers to comment or like, then configure the post URL and a custom message in the app. The system automatically sends that message via DM to everyone who fulfills the specified condition on the tweet.

## College-rag
